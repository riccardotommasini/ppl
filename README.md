# Principle of Programming Languages

This repository contains the material related to the practical classes of the course Principles of Programming Languages 

## 28/10/2016 Scheme 1
- Code Style Guide
- Basic Concepts: recursion, tail recursion, conditional structures, variable binding (define, let, let*), named let
- Basic Lists: handy functions, immutability, quick-sort

## 04/11/2016 Scheme 2
- Named let translations
- Argument Passing and Keywords
- Vectors: Quick Sort
- Structs: Trees
- Macro ( quick overview)

## 11/11/2016 Scheme 4
- Macro: why, examples: for, 
- Continuations: first steps

## 15/11/2016 Scheme 4
- Continuations: clarifiction, coroutines, choose
- Higher order functions: exercise on foldl, foldr
- Macro: repeat-until

## 02/12/2016 Haskell 1
- basics: function, lists, pattern matching, currying, guards 
- Higher order functions (foldl), list comprehension 
- Types: Binary Tree | TraffiLight

## 21/12/2016 Haskell 2
- basics: aias, accessor, type sum and products
- Towards Monads: Foldable, Functor, Applicative (Logger example)

## 13/01/2016 Haskell 3
- Repetita Iuvant: Functor, Applicative
- Logger as a Monad
- Monadic Laws, do notation

## 20/01/2016 Haskell 4
- Logger Monad (tree ex)
- State Monad 

## 24/01/2016 Erlang 1
- Types: Lists, Tuples, atoms, primitives
- List comprehension, pattern matching, 
- conditionals: guards, if 
- higher order functions




### Proposed Homeworks
	- [Scheme] Alternative tree representation
	- [Scheme] Heap priority queue structure
	- [Scheme] Dijkstra's Algorithm
	- [Scheme] Think lambda as macros
	- [Scheme] coroutines as macros?
	- [Scheme] choose with arrays trying a random order fro selecting next paths
	- [Haskell] Monadic Heap
	- [Erlang] Filter, Map with folds
	- [Erlang] Tree in Erlang
